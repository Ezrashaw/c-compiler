# ðŸš€ RCC (Rust C Compiler) ðŸš€

*NOTE: The master branch is not actively developed, see the new [rewrite](https://github.com/Ezrashaw/rcc/tree/rewrite) branch with new features such as an LLVM backend (while keeping x86_64) and a C pretty printer. The rewrite branch is slightly less developed but is more polished.*
